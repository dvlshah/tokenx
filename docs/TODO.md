# tokenx Project Status & Roadmap

## What Works

1. **Provider Interface Architecture**: Core provider pattern is implemented and works correctly
2. **YAML Configuration**: Multi-provider YAML structure properly loads and scales pricing data
3. **Cost Calculator Core**: Base calculation logic for tokens-to-cost conversion works correctly
4. **OpenAI Support**: Full OpenAI support is in place, with robust cost calculations working
5. **Provider Registry**: Auto-discovery mechanism for providers is implemented
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Core calculations maintain backward compatibility with the old API
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages is implemented
8. **Token Extraction**: Support for all OpenAI response formats (dict, Pydantic) is working
9. **Cached Token Handling**: Support for extracting and pricing cached tokens is working

## TODO List for Phase 2 (Anthropic Support)

1. **Anthropic Provider Setup**:
   - [ ] Create Anthropic adapter class implementing ProviderAdapter
   - [ ] Implement token extraction from Anthropic responses
   - [ ] Add detection logic for Anthropic client

2. **Anthropic Pricing**:
   - [ ] Add Anthropic model pricing to YAML configuration
   - [ ] Support Anthropic-specific pricing structures

3. **Testing for Anthropic**:
   - [ ] Develop unit tests for Anthropic adapter
   - [ ] Create integration tests for Anthropic API

## TODO List for Phase 3 (Google Gemini Support)

1. **Gemini Provider Setup**:
   - [ ] Create Gemini adapter class implementing ProviderAdapter
   - [ ] Implement token extraction from Gemini responses
   - [ ] Add detection logic for Gemini client

2. **Gemini Pricing**:
   - [ ] Add Gemini model pricing to YAML configuration
   - [ ] Support Gemini-specific pricing structures and volume-based pricing

3. **Testing for Gemini**:
   - [ ] Develop unit tests for Gemini adapter
   - [ ] Create integration tests for Gemini API

## Future Enhancements

1. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Add more examples for each provider
   - [ ] Create usage guides for common scenarios
   - [ ] Add API reference documentation

2. **Metrics Improvements**:
   - [ ] Add provider-specific metrics (e.g., model details)
   - [ ] Enhance latency tracking with additional breakdowns
   - [ ] Support for custom metrics collection

3. **Integration Features**:
   - [ ] Add logging integrations
   - [ ] Add monitoring dashboard integrations
   - [ ] Create CLI tools for cost estimation

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - [ ] Add caching for token counting
   - [ ] Optimize token extraction for speed
   - [ ] Reduce memory usage for large responses
